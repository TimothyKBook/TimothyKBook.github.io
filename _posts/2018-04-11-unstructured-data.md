Data analysis isn't all just cells and spreadsheets.

One of my last projects at Summit was a blog post on unstructured data. It is
now posthumously posted to the [Summit](www.summitllc.us) blog. Check it out
[here!](https://www.summitllc.us/blog/strength-in-numbers-unstructured-data)

This post also references a previous high-level post I co-authored on natural
language processing (NLP). Check that one out [here!](https://www.summitllc.us/blog/when-computers-understand-us)
