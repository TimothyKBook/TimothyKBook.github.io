  title: DC DataCon 2017
---

Last week, I was fortunate enough to attend the inaugural DC DataCon here in Washington, DC.  I wrote about this experience on my company blog [here](https://www.summitllc.us/blog/notes-from-this-years-dc-datacon).

In short, the conference was a wonderful and educational experience.  Can't wait for next year!
