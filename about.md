Hello!  My name is Tim, and I am a lead data science instructor with General
Assembly in Washington, DC. I currently train Booz Allen Hamilton employees in Python and data science. I graduated from the Ohio State University's Department of Statistics, receiving my MS in statistics. Before Ohio State, I received my Bachelor's in mathematics and statistics from Penn State.
<br><br>
I'm a math geek *and* a data geek. I love bringing theory into application, and
wrapping it up with a neat visual.
