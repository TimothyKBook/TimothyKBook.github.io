Hello!  My name is Tim, and I am a data scientist with Summit Consulting in
Washington, DC, serving as a litigation analyst.  I graduated from the Ohio
State University's Department of Statistics, receiving my MS in statistics.
Before Ohio State, I received my Bachelor's in mathematics and statistics from
Penn State.
<br><br>
I'm a math geek *and* a data geek.  I love bringing theory into application, and
wrapping it up with a neat visual.
