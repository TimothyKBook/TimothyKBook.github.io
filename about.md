Hello!  My name is Tim, and I am a lead data science instructor with General
Assembly in Washington, DC. I currently train Booz Allen Hamilton employees in Python and data science. I graduated from the Ohio State University's Department of Statistics, receiving my MS in statistics. Before Ohio State, I received my Bachelor's in mathematics and statistics from Penn State.
<br><br>
I'm a math geek *and* a data geek. I love bringing theory into application, and
wrapping it up with a neat visual.

### Language Skills
R, Python, C/C++, Stata, SQL, SAS

### Typesetting/Reporting
LaTeX, (R)Markdown, Jupyter

### Misc. Technical Specialties
AWS, Git, Bash scripting, the Python data science stack (numpy, pandas, scipy,
sci-kit learn, nltk), Keras, RShiny, the "tidyverse", ggplot2

### Analytical Specialties
(Generalized) linear model theory, statistical machine learning, regularization
techniques, robust methods, kernel methods, tree methods, smoothing methods,
data visualization, sampling techniques, natural language processing (NLP)

### What am I working on now?
Right now, I'm taking a very deep dive into learning as much deep learning as possible. I'm working my way through Fran√ßois Chollet's _Deep Learning with Python_, which is an excellent resource. I plan to focus on learning everything I can about sequence data, specifically NLP and time series analysis using RNNs.
