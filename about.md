Hello!  My name is Tim, and I am a lead data science instructor with General Assembly in Washington, DC. I currently teach GA's Data Science Immserive (DSI) course, in which students make full career pivots into data science. Our graduates transition from potentially knowing nothing of the field into serious job candidates that can hit the ground running in any data science role. Previously, I worked for Summit Consulting as a member of the data science team in their litigation directorate. My analyses, models, and visualizations have been used as evidence in billion-dollar court cases

I graduated from the Ohio State University's Department of Statistics, receiving my MS in statistics. Before Ohio State, I received my Bachelor's in mathematics and statistics from Penn State.

### What am I working on now?
Right now, I'm studying the C/C++ languages with the goal of using them to speed up the functionality of R (via `Rccp`) and Python (via `Cython`). I'm also currently reading [_Forecasting: Principles and Practice_](https://otexts.com/fpp2/index.html), by Hyndman and Athanasopous to sharpen my time series skills.
